							<dd> <b> My Review: </b> Lighthearted show and is the best comfort show ever. Whenever I felt stressed or sad, I would put Friends on and it would cheer me up and make me laugh. This is a show that I could constantly watch on repeat and not get bored of. The closeness of the friends' bond makes you want to search for the same thing and you yearn to find true love like the couples in the show. </dd>

							<dd> <b> My Review: </b> This show felt very relatable and similar to Friends, it would cheer me up on a gloomy day. It was a whirldwind of scenes that would make you laugh out loud, cry along and offer comfort after a long day. The chaotic storyline of the three families was just perfect. The way they wrote the show in a documentary kind of style just makes you feel as you are part of the show. </dd>

							<dd> <b> My Review: </b> This show reminded me of my childhood when I used to watch Disney shows and read fairy tale stories. I absolutely binge-watched this show in one go as it was so addicting & the story was paced very well so you would never get bored. The storyline just kept on going. I especially loved the romance between the main character, Emma and Captain Hook. It was just perfect. The only thing I did not like was the last season as I felt it was kind of lacking and the writers were reaching the end of their wits. </dd>
