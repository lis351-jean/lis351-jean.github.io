							<dd> <b> My Review: </b> This was one of the first Chinese dramas I ever watched and it is one of my most favorite. If you love the trope of an older guy falling for a younger girl, this is the drama for you. The contrast of the two main characters and their personalities makes you want to continuously follow along with the story till the end. The romantic moments make you swoon and the heartbreak makes your heart hurt. This is a drama that highly captures the audience, along with a funny supporting cast making it an even better storyline. </dd>

							<dd> <b> My Review: </b> This is a drama that really top the charts when I first watched it. It is set in a competitive gaming environment, with both leads working together in the same team. The animosity and chemistry between the cold male lead and the innocent female lead was exhilarating to watch and makes you want even more from them. This rom-com is one my most favorite to re-watch especially the scenes that make you swoon and keep you on your toes. </dd>

							<dd> <b> My Review: </b>  Set in the ancient China timeline, with a twist of fantasy, this drama has one of the best and exciting action scenes in Chinese drama. The visuals and cast are perfect. The main lead couple are a power duo of martial arts to be feared and the way they flow in sync to each other is just amazing. Although the romance is minimal, the chemistry between the leads just sizzles, especially with their banter. </dd>
